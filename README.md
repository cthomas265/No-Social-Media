# No-Social-Media


Using Mongoose ODM, MongoDB/noSQL DB, Express.js for routing; No Social Media shows a simple social networking code. 

Using API requests through Insomnia I demonstrate POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests to create, edit and delete users, thoughts and reactions. 

Included is a GETTER, used for date formating for current date and time.
